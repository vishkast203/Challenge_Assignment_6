# Challenge_Assignment_6
Application of technology to real-estate markets
While I have managed to compete the codes for the entire project, unfortunately I have run into two major problems:
1. My interactive plots do not work on vscode
2. My Jupyter Notebook keeps crashing despite assistance from Rice University instructors.  
My full analysis can only be completed once I have resolved these problems... At this time I am unable to run even the most basic codes (importing libraries)  on JNB...
